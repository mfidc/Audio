    - simple Silero VAD
    - spectral analysis
    - Energy based analysis
    - Zero Crossing Rate
    - Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients

        Individual Analysis Wrappers
        Each return a score or flag, extract different informations
        Weighted scoring system?


- Real-Time Adaptive Noise Reduction

- Dynamic Buffer Management for Transcription
    - Dynamic Buffer Size Adjustment based on speechpatterns and context
    - Intelligent Overlap handling

- Post Transcription Processing
    - Repetition removal
    - Intelligent Concatenation


Constraints:

-Hardware Limitations: using a USB conference microphone with a 16kHz sampling rate and 1-channel output
-Model Compatibility: Utilizing the Faster Whisper model large-v3 for transcription, which does not natively support real-time streaming input.
    ->Therefore we need this big wrapper around it. Goal should be to normally send about 3-10 seconds of audio. (maybe + overlap)
-Environmental Variability: The system must adapt to various acoustic environments, from quiet rooms to noisy outdoor settings.
-Speech Variability: Must handle different speech patterns, accents, and volumes, including soft speech that is far from the microphone and Long thought pauses when talking about complex topics for example
